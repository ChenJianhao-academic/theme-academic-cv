Virtual simulation training education and training plays an important role in Industry 4.0 and the "Made in China 2025" policy [1]. It can not only improve production efficiency and product quality and reduce production risks by simulating complex manufacturing processes, but also By providing an immersive learning environment, it helps students and employees better understand and master complex technologies and processes, improve their practical operation capabilities, and then promote innovation-driven innovation and promote the upgrading and transformation of the manufacturing industry [2].
With the rapid development of Industry 4.0, even if new manufacturing processes such as 3D printing are emerging, traditional computer-controlled machining processes (such as drilling, milling and lathe turning) are still what manufacturing-related students are exposed to in universities. The first manufacturing process [3, 4]. For a long time, CNC (computer numerical control) machine tools have become an indispensable tool in modern manufacturing and a core equipment for students studying and working in manufacturing-related majors. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) has also purchased multiple CNC machine tools for teaching and Scientific research platform.
However, traditional CNC machine tool training methods (such as on-site instruction and textbook learning) are time-consuming, costly, and potentially dangerous to trainees [5]. At the same time, due to the practical application of engineering, students studying machining processes not only need to master the theories and principles of cutting and machine tools, but also need to know how to operate and program machine tools to complete actual manufacturing tasks. Theory and rules are usually explained in the classroom, while theoretical application and operational practice of practical skills take place in a laboratory setting. However, in teaching practice, the transition from classroom to laboratory is not easy and is full of challenges.
Because of technical and administrative difficulties such as limited access to equipment, safety issues, and insufficient supervisory staff, students spend relatively short periods of time practicing in the laboratory [6]. This lack of laboratory experience will hinder students from understanding and visualizing abstract concepts, preventing them from acquiring necessary operational skills, and from getting enough practical exercises or exploring new ideas. Without sufficient laboratory experience, students' basic learning will be insufficient and their career development in the manufacturing industry will be affected [7]. There is also a phenomenon in school equipment that because the current training process is time-consuming and relies on teacher resources, school equipment is idle and cannot be fully used, and students in need cannot receive timely training.
In recent years, an emerging training solution is gradually being tried, which is expected to solve the above problems, that is, to train the machining process of CNC machine tools by simulating the use of mixed reality (MR), including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). In this way, in a simulated environment, students can interact with virtual machines, navigate components and processes, practice programming and operations, and perform other innovative activities that would be expensive and risky in a real environment. It is worth mentioning that AR and VR modules do not replace laboratory courses, but provide students with simulation training so that they can participate in actual laboratory operations more confidently, safely and effectively. Teaching methods using virtual reality can also benefit some other learners, especially those with limited mobility or other disabilities due to laboratory environment and safety issues, as well as online learning who are unable to use precision machine tools due to geographical distance and time constraints. By. Virtual reality modules can provide them with another way to gain practical experience and theoretical knowledge. Mixed reality (MR) education and training is safe, immersive, relatively low-cost, and can cultivate students' computational thinking and real-machine practical abilities [8]. It has been tried for industrial education and training at home and abroad.
However, traditional industrial virtual training education is usually a single-person experience and lacks social interaction. While virtual reality education provides an immersive learning experience, participants may lose peer interaction and cooperative learning opportunities in the real world, resulting in their Feelings of inadequacy and emptiness at the level of social and cooperative abilities [9-11]. Moreover, for group education, a large amount of equipment is required, the cost is high, and the training efficiency is relatively low. The current virtual practical training education still needs to be optimized and reformed. A group, highly interactive, and assessable fast industrial teaching framework deserves to be proposed.
This research proposal aims to explore how to apply MR (Mixed Reality), including AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) technologies to enhance the group training capabilities of CNC machine tools and improve students’ objective training effects (basic knowledge memory, accurate operation rate, familiar with safety education emergency response), provide safer, more efficient and assessable group learning solutions and experiences, and plan to integrate the virtual training system into the university's laboratory safety assessment system.

虚拟仿真实训教育和培训在工业4.0和《中国制造2025》政策中扮演着重要角色[1]，它不仅能通过模拟复杂的制造过程来提高生产效率和产品质量，减少生产风险，而且还可以通过提供沉浸式的学习环境，帮助学生和员工更好地理解和掌握复杂的技术和工艺，提升他们的实际操作能力，进而推动创新驱动，促进制造业的升级和转型[2]。
随着工业 4.0 的快速发展，即使3D打印这样的新的制造工艺正在出现，计算机控制的传统加工过程(如：钻井、铣削和车床车削)，仍然是与制造相关的学生在大学中接触到的第一个制造过程[3, 4]。长期以来，CNC（计算机数控）机床已成为现代制造业中必不可少的工具，也是制造业相关专业学生学习和工作的核心设备，香港科技大学（广州）也采购了多台数控机床作为教学和科研平台。
然而，传统的数控机床培训方法（如现场指导和课本学习）耗时长、成本高，而且对受训者有潜在危险[5]。同时，由于工程学的实际应用性，学习加工过程的学生不仅需要掌握切割和机床的理论、原理，还需要懂得如何操作和编程机床来完成实际制造任务。理论和规则通常在课堂被讲解，而实践技能的理论应用和操作实践则在实验室环境中进行。然而，在教学实践中，从课堂到实验室的过渡却并不容易，充满各种挑战。
因为设备使用有限、安全问题以及监督人员不足等技术和行政上的困难，学生在实验室实践的时间相对较短[6]。这种实验室经验的缺乏，会阻碍学生对抽象概念的理解和视觉化，影响他们获得必要的操作技能，以及得到足够的实机练习或者是探索新的想法。如果没有足够的实验室经验，学生的基础学习将会不足，他们在制造业的职业发展也会受到影响[7]。校内的设备也存在因为目前的培训流程耗时长，且依赖师资资源，导致学校设备闲置，得不到充分的使用，有需求的学生也得不到及时的培训的现象。
近年来，一种新兴的培训方案正在被逐渐地尝试，有望解决上述问题，即通过模拟使用混合现实（MR），包括增强现实（AR）和虚拟现实（VR）来培训数控机床的加工过程。通过这种方式，在模拟环境中，学生可以与虚拟机器互动，导航组件和过程，练习编程和操作，进行其他在实际环境中昂贵且有风险的创新活动。值得一提的是，AR和VR模块并不取代实验室课程，而是为学生提供模拟训练，使他们更有自信、安全、有效地参与实际实验室操作。使用虚拟现实的教学方法也能让一些其他学习者受益，特别是那些由于实验室环境和安全问题，行动不便或有其他残疾的学生，以及由于地理距离和时间限制，无法使用精密机床的在线学习者。虚拟现实模块可以为他们提供另一种获得实践经验和理论知识的途径。混合现实（MR）教育培训有着安全，沉浸，相对低成本的特点，且可以培养学生的计算思维（computational thinking）和实机实践能力[8]，已经在国内外被尝试用于工业教育培训。
然而，传统的工业虚拟实训教育通常为单人体验，缺乏社交互动，虚拟现实教育在提供沉浸式学习体验的同时，参与者可能会失去现实世界中的同伴互动与合作学习机会，从而导致他们在社交和合作能力层面上感到不足和空虚[9-11]。且对于群体教育而言所需设备数量多，成本高, 培训效率较为低下。现行的虚拟实训教育仍然有待优化和改革，一种群体性的，高互动性，可评估的快捷工业教学框架值得被提出。
本研究提案旨在探索如何应用MR（混合现实）， 包括AR（增强现实）和 VR（虚拟现实）技术来增强数控机床的群体培训的能力，提高学员的客观训练效果（基础知识记忆，操作准确率，熟悉安全教育突发情况处置），提供更安全高效和可评估的群体学习方案和体验,且计划将虚拟培训系统接入大学的实验室安全考核体系之中。
